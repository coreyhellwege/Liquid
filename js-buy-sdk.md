## Basics

The JavaScript Buy SDK is a lightweight library that allows you to build ecommerce into any website hosted outside of Shopify. It is based on Shopifyâ€™s API and provides the ability to retrieve products and collections from your shop, add products to a cart, and checkout.

JS Buy SDK is an API client built on top of the REST API using fetch to make HTTP requests.

#### Benefits:

- Allows you to access product data outside of the online store
- Allows you ro retrieve and manage this data without having to write all the boilerplate code usually required when using JavaScript to consume a REST API
- Don't need to deal with authentication
- Don't need to deal with AJAX requests

#### Features:
- Promise-based interface - Ensures operations and fetches have completed before moving to the next block of code
- Models with dynamic properties
- Small footprint
- Polyfills for browser support
