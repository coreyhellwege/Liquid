Liquid is an open-source template language created by Shopify and written in Ruby. It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on storefronts.

- Liquid creates a bridge between template files and data
- Functional Liquid code is highly reusable across multiple projects

## How it works:

1. When a request is made in the browser to load a particular Shopify store, Shopify selects the required Liquid template from the active theme directory and works out which template file is being requested (e.g. product page, home page, collection page etc). 
2. The Liquid placeholders are then replaced with HTML data stored on the Shopify platform and compiled into a HTML file which is sent to the browser.
3. Finally the browser processes the HTML file and fetches all other required assets (e.g. images, JavaScript, CSS etc).

## File extension:

```liquid
.liquid
```
`index.liquid` - Homepage template

`theme.liquid` - Layout file

- The .liquid extension can be appended to both JavaScript and CSS files. E.g. `site.js.liquid`. This allows us to pull data from the Shopify platform into these files.

## Syntax:

```liquid
{% for image in product.images %}
  <!-- logic -->
<img src="{{ image | img_url: 'medium' }}>
  <!-- output -->
{% endfor %}
```

- Objects use the dot syntax <br>
E.g. shop object has properties associated with it such as name, address, currency

- Loops allow iteration over objects

- Filters manipulate output <br>
E.g. a date/time stamp can be filtered to output a readable format

- Logic controls output flow <br> 
E.g. If an item is in stock output X, if itâ€™s out of stock output Y

- Operators allow comparison <br>
E.g. If an item is greater than $X output Y code

## Examples:

### Output:

```liquid
<h2>{{ product.title }}</h2>
```
At run-time this will be replaced by the product title

### Objects & Properties:

```liquid
<div>{{ shop.description }}</div>

<!-- shop = object
description = property -->
```
### Liquid Collections:

```liquid
shop.enabled_payment_types
shop.metafields
shop.types
```

A group of objects that are all the same. E.g. Product images, users in the database etc.

Don't confuse this with Product Collections which are a group of products grouped together.

- Collections are signified by plural object names
- Each individual item has it's own properties
- Loops allow us to output items in a collection
- You can also target individual items directly by using .first .last etc

### Loops:

```liquid
{% for image in product.images %}
<img src="{{ image | img_url: 'medium' }}>
{% endfor %}
```

This loop will output each product image

- `image` is a placeholder name
- `image_url` is a shopify specific liquid filter which will grab each image URL
- `medium` refers to the image size you would like to output. Shopify auto-generates various sizes of uploaded images.

### Logic:

- Controls what is output in a template
- Uses common language constructs. E.g. if and else

```liquid
{% if product.available %}
  <h2>Price: $99.00</h2>
{% else %}
  <h2 class="sold-out">Sorry, sold out</h2>
{% endif %}
```

This conditional will render one of two strings

### Filters:

- They manipulate output data in some way
- They allow our themes to be agnostic and reusable
- They reduce the amount of code we write
- The argument on the left side of the pipes is the target object, and the argument on the right side of the pipes is the filter

```liquid
<p class="date-time">
  {{ article.published_at | date: '%d %B %Y' }}
</p>
```

This filter specifies the format for published date

- `article` is an object
- `published_at` is a property of article

```liquid
{{ 'style.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
```

These filters append the CSS file to the theme and generate a stylesheet tag. 

- `asset_url` is a filter URL to the current store's active theme
- `stylesheet_tag` is a filter which generates a stylesheet tag which can be injected into the layout file

### Operators: 

- Allow us to compare variables

```liquid
{% if cart.item_count > 0 %}
<p>You have {{ cart.item_count }}
{{ cart.item_count | pluralize: 'item', 'items' }} in your cart</p>
{% else %}
<p>There's nothing in your cart. Why not have a <a href="/products">look at our product range</a></p>
{% endif %}
```

This logic uses a conditional, filter and operator to display the number of items in the user's cart, or a link to products if the cart is empty.
